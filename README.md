  **TITLE OF PROJECT:** 

DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT PHONEBOOK 

 
  
  **DATE:**  

 08 October 2024
 


**DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT**


The team developed a comprehensive and user-friendly phonebook application designed to streamline contact management.
The program is structured into several key modules, each with specific functions.
**The contact management module** includes the function **addActionListener()** tied to the **“Add Contact” button**, which allows users to effortlessly add/insert new contacts, ensuring that essential information such as name and phone number are captured accurately. 
**The display module** provides an intuitive interface with **List1.setListData()** and **List2.setListData() functions**, allowing users to view their contacts in a clear and organized manner. 

To further enhance usability, **the sorting module** includes a **Collection.sort(namesArray); function**, which enables users to arrange contacts alphabetically by name for quick access.
**The delete and update modules** offer two key functions: the delete function uses an **ActionListener ()**, which easily removes outdated entries, and the update function uses a **confirmBtn.addActionListener()** which allows users to edit existing contact information.

Additionally, the search module incorporates an **ActionListener** and a **namesArray.indexOf() function**, which facilitates the rapid retrieval of contacts using a search-by-name mechanism, significantly enhancing the overall user experience.
Each module works cohesively to ensure a seamless and efficient phonebook management system.

**HOW WE GOT THE FUNCTIONALITIES, SERVICES AND REQUIREMENTS (FSR) OF THE SOFTWARE**

To establish the functionalities and services for our software, our team focused on identifying the specific requirements (inserting, sorting, searching, displaying all contacts, updating existing entries, and deleting contacts) for an efficient phonebook. 
We conducted extensive research to gain insights into these requirements, leading us to identify key functionalities which include the ability to carry out intuitive navigation, data management, sorting algorithms, search algorithms and persistent storage (the ability to retain contacts even when the application is closed). 

The conducted research also allowed us to review existing methodologies and best practices related to data structures and algorithms, which are relevant to our phonebook functionalities. This research included analyzing the efficiency of various search algorithms, understanding memory management, and evaluating user interface design principles. 
 
The team also took part in a structured brainstorming session. During this session, members shared insights and proposed innovative ideas based on their findings.
This collaborative environment encouraged creative problem-solving and allowed the exploration of diverse perspectives on algorithm design.
This brainstorm session also provided room for iterative discussions, which lead to the development of a comprehensive algorithm designed to efficiently manage contacts.
